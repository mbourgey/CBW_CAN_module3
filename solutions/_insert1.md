Probably the different library came from different shearing methods (or technician):
 
    - The shearing sometime generated longer fragments (~500 bp) but with low precision (SD -+ 70 bp)
    - The shearing sometime generated shorter fragments (~300 bp) but with high precision (SD -+ 25 bp)
    - The shearing sometime generated shorter fragments (~300 bp) but with low precision (SD -+ 90 bp) which could be the sign of problem at this step !
