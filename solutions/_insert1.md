Probably the normal and tumor samples had different shearing methods (or technician):
 
    - The shearing of the normal sample generated longer fragments (348 bp) but with low precision (SD -+ 91 bp)
    - The shearing of the tumor sample generated shorter fragments (275 bp) but with high precision (SD -+ 23 bp)
