2:30:15 => <seed mismatches\>:<palindrome clipthreshold\>:<simple clip threshold\> 
 
   - seedMismatches: specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed
   - palindromeClipThreshold: specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
   - simpleClipThreshold: specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read..
